# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-and-Cancellation-Prediction
The dataset includes features such as booking details, guest demographics, and reservation status. The goal is to explore the data, identify patterns and trends, and build a predictive model to predict whether a booking will be canceled or not.


Approach:

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify trends, and uncover potential insights related to hotel bookings.

Feature Engineering: Perform feature engineering to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover relationships between features and the target variable (booking cancellation), and identify key factors influencing cancellation decisions.

Model Development: Develop a predictive model to classify bookings as either canceled or not canceled. I will use random forests for model development

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

Interpretation and Insights: Interpret the results of the predictive model and provide actionable insights to hotel management based on the identified patterns and predictive factors.
